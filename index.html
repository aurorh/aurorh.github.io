                <h2> About Me</h2>
                <p>I am currently working on finishing my Data Analytics certificate, and I am looking to start
                    my
                    career in
                    Data Analytics or Database Management.
                    I have always had a passion for evidence-based reasoning, and that has led me down the path of
                    learning
                    to
                    use
                    data to understand and make complex decisions.
                    I am an organized, detail-oriented person, who works well with others, but am still
                    self-motivated
                    on my
                    own

                <p> This is a personal project, one that I have been keeping up with for over 2 years now.
                    Sleep is very important to me, and because of a varying work schedule I wasn't sure if I was getting
                    enough sleep.
                    I decided to start recording it in a journal and averaging out the weeks and months.
                    When I started back at school last year, I decided to input it into Excel to do some visualizations!

                <p>I wanted the table to automatically calculate the total (duration of sleep), since it was a place I
                    most
                    often made a mistake.
                    However, Excel doesn't behave predictably when it comes to calculating "totals" with time. </p>
                <p> The major issue is when it tries to calculate on a sleep duration that passes through midnight i.e.
                    PM to AM, or PM to PM of the next day. </p>

                    Now I just need to write a formula so that my table can adjust for this automatically, otherwise I
                    will need to go in and fix all the MHC's.

                        Scenario 2</i> and so on.
                    If RHC is positive (greater than zero) we use RHC. If RHC is negative (less than zero) we use MHC.
                    The third case is for when RHC is zero, which means it is an empty row and it needs to remain blank
                    so the Total Average won't be interfered.

                This is a data visualization project I did in Jupyter Notebook mapping the energy use of each
                non-residential and multi-family building in Seattle.
                These are the two data sets I used: <br>
            </p>
            <td colspan="2">
                <p>
                    <a href="https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::zip-codes/about"
                        target="_blank" rel=”noopener”>Seattle Building Energy Benchmarking</a> <br> <br>
                    Building_Energy_Benchmarking has stats on many energy use benchmarks for most big-ish (>20,000 sqft)
                    buildings in the city, as well as each building's address, ZIP Code, year-built, ect.
                    The statistic I'm using for this map is the SiteEUI(kBtu/sf), which they describe as:
                    "Site Energy Use Intensity (EUI) is a property's Site Energy Use divided by its gross floor area.
                    Site Energy Use is the annual amount of all the energy consumed by the property on-site, as reported
                    on utility bills.
                    Site EUI is measured in thousands of British thermal units (kBtu) per square foot."
                    I chose this statistic because it wasn't missing very much data and it is based on square-footage,
                    so large buildings won't skew the data.

                    This is a GeoJson file mapping out King County. It has King County sectioned off by ZIP Code which
                    will match up nicely with the ZIP Codes in the CSV file. <br> <br>
                    My goal with this project was to use the CSV file to average out the data per building of each ZIP
                    Code, then use those figures to create a heat map with the GeoJson file, and all to be done with
                    Python code.
                    Eventually I landed on using Jupyter Notebook because of the ability to split chunks of the code
                    into "cells", which could be run one step at a time.

                    I also went into the CSV file and filled the blank ZIP Code fields by putting the building's address

                    Next I cast the data as integer, and then as string so that the folium module can render the heat

                <p> This was a project for my SQL class in 2021. I needed to create a Database purely writing in SQL using mySQL as the user interface. 
                    I am a big crafter, especially with knitting and crocheting, so I decided to make my database a way to keep track of those supplies. 
                    At the end of the project, I created a PowerPoint and presented it to my classmates. 
                    <br><br>
                    This is a yarn label showing most of the info I would be tracking about the yarns. I included all of the tools into the datbase as well.
